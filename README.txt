# üß† AI Workflow Integration Suite  
### TypeScript + Express + OpenAI SDK

This project is part of my **AI Integration Engineer / AI Solutions Engineer** portfolio.  
It demonstrates how to integrate **Large Language Models (LLMs)** into real-world business workflows using a **Node.js + TypeScript** backend.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The **AI Workflow Integration Suite** is a modular backend API built to showcase:
- **LLM integration** using the OpenAI SDK  
- **Agentic automation** and streaming responses  
- **Secure environment configuration** with `.env`  
- **Observability and production-readiness** (latency, usage, and cost tracking)

It forms the foundation for:
- Chat-based assistants  
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines  
- Workflow automation demos (Sales, Legal, and Operations)
